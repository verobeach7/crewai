### Vegetarian Greek Dinner

This delightful vegetarian Greek dinner includes Vegetarian Moussaka, Greek Salad, and Tzatziki sauce. Each dish retains the traditional essence of Greek cuisine but is tailored for a vegetarian audience. 

#### 1. Vegetarian Moussaka

**Ingredients:**

- 2 large eggplants, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 carrot, diced
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 cup mushrooms, chopped (or 1 cup cooked lentils for a lentil version)
- 1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 3 large potatoes, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch rounds
- 1 cup plant-based yogurt (for béchamel sauce)
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast (optional for cheesy flavor)
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch (for thickness)
- Fresh parsley for garnish

**Preparation Instructions:**

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Lightly brush the eggplant slices with olive oil and roast them on a baking sheet for 20 minutes, turning halfway until golden and soft.
3. In a large skillet, heat the remaining olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic; sauté until translucent.
4. Add the carrot, bell pepper, and mushrooms (or lentils). Cook for about 5 minutes until softened.
5. Stir in the diced tomatoes, oregano, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
6. In another pot, parboil the potato slices in salted water for about 10 minutes until slightly tender. Drain and set aside.
7. In a bowl, mix the plant-based yogurt, nutritional yeast, and cornstarch to create a thick béchamel sauce.
8. Layer the moussaka in a large baking dish: start with a layer of potatoes, followed by the vegetable mixture, then a layer of roasted eggplant. Repeat until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of potatoes and topping with the béchamel sauce.
9. Bake for 45 minutes until golden and bubbly.
10. Allow to cool slightly before serving. Garnish with fresh parsley.

#### 2. Greek Salad

**Ingredients:**

- 3 cups chopped cucumbers
- 2 cups chopped tomatoes
- 1 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 bell pepper, sliced (any color)
- 1 cup kalamata olives
- 1 cup feta cheese crumbles or cubed tofu (for a vegan option)
- 4 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper, to taste

**Preparation Instructions:**

1. In a large bowl, combine the cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion, bell pepper, and olives.
2. If using feta cheese, crumble it over the salad, or for vegan option, add the cubed tofu.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper.
4. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine.
5. Serve immediately or refrigerate for 30 minutes for the flavors to meld.

#### 3. Tzatziki Sauce

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup plant-based yogurt
- 1 cucumber, grated and squeezed to remove excess moisture
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh dill, chopped (optional)

**Preparation Instructions:**

1. In a bowl, combine the plant-based yogurt, grated cucumber, garlic, olive oil, and red wine vinegar.
2. Mix well and season with salt, pepper, and dill (if using).
3. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to let the flavors develop.

### Serving Suggestions:

- Serve the Vegetarian Moussaka hot from the oven with a side of Greek Salad and a generous dollop of Tzatziki sauce.
- Pair with some warm pita bread for a complete meal.
- This meal is perfect for gatherings or family dinners, making the flavors of Greece accessible and enjoyable at home.

### Ingredient Substitutions:

- **For the Moussaka**: If you don’t have nutritional yeast, it can be omitted or replaced with a vegan cheese blend.
- **For the Greek Salad**: Any cheese alternative can be used instead of feta. 
- **For the Tzatziki**: The thick plant-based yogurt is essential, but any similar non-dairy yogurt can work.
