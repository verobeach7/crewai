### Ingredients Required (Serves 5)

**For the Vegetarian Greek Moussaka:**
- 2 medium eggplants, sliced into ½ inch rounds
- 1 pound lentils (or 1 can of cooked lentils, rinsed and drained)
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 4 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced into ¼ inch rounds
- 3 cups béchamel sauce (see below for ingredients)
- ½ cup grated parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast for a dairy-free option

**For the Béchamel Sauce:**
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter (or olive oil for a dairy-free option)
- 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups almond milk (or any plant-based milk)
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons water (as an egg substitute)
- ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Preparation Instructions

1. **Prepare the Eggplants:**
   - Sprinkle the sliced eggplants with salt and let them sit for about 30 minutes to draw out excess moisture. Rinse and pat them dry with a paper towel.

2. **Cook the Lentil Mixture:**
   - In a large skillet, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic and sauté until fragrant. 
   - Stir in the lentils (if using dried, ensure they are pre-cooked), crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, cinnamon, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 20 minutes until the mixture thickens, then set aside.

3. **Cook the Potatoes:**
   - Boil the sliced potatoes in salted water for about 5 minutes until slightly tender. Drain and set aside.

4. **Cook the Eggplants:**
   - In the same skillet, heat another tablespoon of olive oil and sauté the eggplant slices on both sides until golden brown. Set aside.

5. **Make the Béchamel Sauce:**
   - In a saucepan, melt butter (or heat olive oil) over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 2 minutes. Gradually add the almond milk while whisking continuously to avoid lumps. 
   - Cook until the sauce thickens, then remove from heat. Stir in the cornstarch mixture, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.

6. **Assemble the Moussaka:**
   - Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
   - In a large baking dish, layer half the potato slices, followed by half the eggplant slices, and half the lentil mixture. Repeat the layers.
   - Pour the béchamel sauce over the top and sprinkle with parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast.

7. **Bake:**
   - Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes until the top is golden brown.

8. **Rest and Serve:**
   - Allow the moussaka to rest for about 15 minutes before slicing and serving.

### Serving Suggestions
Serve the vegetarian moussaka warm, garnished with fresh parsley. Pair with a colorful Greek salad made from tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, olives, and a sprinkle of feta cheese or avocado, dressed with olive oil and oregano. A glass of red wine or sparkling water with lemon would complement this dish beautifully. Enjoy your healthy vegetarian Greek dinner!

### Explanation of the Replaced Ingredients
- **Ground Lamb or Beef** has been replaced with **lentils**, which provide protein and a hearty texture to the dish, maintaining the essence of a rich Greek moussaka.
- **Egg Yolk** in the béchamel sauce is replaced with a mixture of cornstarch and water, which acts as a thickening agent and helps to bind the sauce without the use of eggs.
- **Whole Milk** has been substituted with **almond milk**, making the béchamel sauce dairy-free while still creating a creamy consistency.
- **Parmesan Cheese** can be replaced with **nutritional yeast** for a vegan option, offering a cheesy flavor without animal products.

This vegetarian version retains the warmth and flavor of traditional moussaka while being suitable for plant-based diets!
