      "As 2024 draws to a close, the annual time has come for all movie lovers to think back on the films released this year. It has certainly been an exciting year for movies , with many major blockbusters like Dune Part Two and Wicked managing to delight both critics and audiences alike. However, not every film from the last 12 months has experienced the same level of success. When looking back at the most recent year in cinema, it is important to also remember the films that didn't do quite as well and why.\n",
      "As is typically the case with any year, several 2024 films severely underwhelmed their audiences, becoming undeniable flops at the box office . Whether it be because of lousy filmmaking, poor advertising, or something else altogether, these movies were not received nearly as well as their creators had envisioned. Regardless of how they were expected to perform or even their true quality, these films proved to be the biggest flops of 2024.\n",

      "Kevin Costner is no stranger to Westerns, but his latest addition to the genre has decidedly not been the most well-received. Halfway through 2024, he released the first film in an entire series he is planning to co-write, direct, and star in. Titled Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 , this introductory film is meant to set the stage for the franchise, following the lives of an assortment of characters struggling to get by in the Midwest during the Civil War.\n",
      "In order for the franchise to be a success, the later installments will have to do much better than the first one. Although it was made on a budget of $50 million, Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 only managed to bring in $38.2 at the box office, a statistic that could prove to be a dangerous warning sign for the future of the series. Part of the underwhelming results can perhaps be attributed to the film's imposing runtime, coming in at over three hours long, a very intimidating length considering there are meant to be three more installments.\n",

      "Oftentimes, remaking popular films feels like a surefire way for studios to easily make a sizable profit. However, the 2024 remake of The Crow , originally inspired by a James O'Barr comic series, proved that the strategy is not an absolute guaranteed success. Starring horror icon Bill Skarsgård and FKA Twigs, The Crow tells the haunting story of a vengeful man who is brought back to life after he and his girlfriend are both killed.\n",
      "At the box office, The Crow massively underperformed, especially when compared to other modern reboots of classic stories, even others in the horror genre specifically. The film raked in a mere $24 million at the box office, just under half of its original $50 million budget. Adding insult to injury, the film also received consistently negative reviews, establishing the project as a failure on all fronts.\n",

Released in April, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare offers an action-packed, highly fictionalized account of a daring mission during World War II . Ritchie has certainly explored the action-comedy genre before, but this latest effort was far from his most profitable attempt to do so.\n",

This was far from enough to dub the film a success, though, as it only accumulated a mere $27.3 million at the box office. Having a budget of $60 million, this was not nearly enough to satisfy the team behind the film. Ritchie will definitely be hoping his next film does significantly better.\n",

      "While the film inspired a very wide range of opinions (ranging all the way from \"disaster\" to \"masterpiece\"), one aspect of Megalopolis is clear as day: it was a colossal flop at the box office. The budget, which was reportedly supplied entirely by Coppola himself, was estimated to be approximately $120-136 million. One can only imagine Coppola's dismay when the film only managed to recuperate around 10 percent of that. These disheartening numbers easily make Megalopolis one of the biggest flops in recent memory .\n",
