      "### Explanation of the Replaced Ingredients\n",
      "- **Ground Lamb or Beef** has been replaced with **lentils**, which provide protein and a hearty texture to the dish, maintaining the essence of a rich Greek moussaka.\n",
      "- **Egg Yolk** in the béchamel sauce is replaced with a mixture of cornstarch and water, which acts as a thickening agent and helps to bind the sauce without the use of eggs.\n",
      "- **Whole Milk** has been substituted with **almond milk**, making the béchamel sauce dairy-free while still creating a creamy consistency.\n",
      "- **Parmesan Cheese** can be replaced with **nutritional yeast** for a vegan option, offering a cheesy flavor without animal products.\n",
