Why Use Interactive Video Ads in Your Marketing Strategy? Best Interactive Video Examples to Learn From  Need an Interactive Video? Yum Yum Videos Can Help! Interactive Videos: FAQ Wrapping up Video marketing strategies have completely changed the way consumers and brands interact with one another. Nowadays, video is one of the best ways for companies to attract customers, engage with them, and keep them interested enough to eventually persuade them to make a purchase. However, a new player has emerged that has the potential to change the game for traditional videos, and those are interactive videos . In this article, I’ll go over this innovative video format, its advantages, and how you can use it to draw in viewers, differentiate your business from competitors, and give your audience an unforgettable experience. To make things even better, I’ll break down 16 interactive video examples so you can watch and learn from the best. Let’s go!   Table of Contents What Are Interactive Videos? Interactive Video Ads: What Benefits Do They Have to Offer? Why Use Interactive Video Ads in Your Marketing Strategy? Best Interactive Video Examples to Learn From  Need an Interactive Video? Yum Yum Videos Can Help! Interactive Videos: FAQ Wrapping up What Are Interactive Videos? An interactive video is a form of media that allows users to engage with the content within the video itself. It’s called “interactive” because viewers can manipulate certain elements of the video, changing the direction, storyline, or characters in the way they want to through a variety of tools. In traditional videos, you only have a limited series of functions: clicking “play” to start, pause, rewind, fast forward, or restart. On the other side, succesfull interactive video examples allow users to manipulate the content by clicking, dragging, scrolling, hovering, gyrating, and performing other digital actions—just like you’d do with a video game or a website. These clickable areas are called “hotspots,” and they allow viewers to modify the storyline with their actions to create a nonlinear narrative , go through different paths, and obtain new possible outcomes. Sounds fun, right?   Interactive Video Ads: What Benefits Do They Have to Offer? Videos are a very flexible format that can support businesses in multiple ways. From an explainer video displaying how your product or service works, to the common video commercial, video content can be designed to support businesses no matter what industry they’re in, what goal they’re aiming for, or what audience they’re targeting. Still, while being more engaging than other static formats, like text or images, videos also pose limitations—especially when it comes to audience retention. As customers get more and more accustomed to video ads, figuring out how to bring customers to your business with content becomes harder.  Interactive video examples aim to solve this issue. By forcing viewers to engage with the content for it to advance, keeping the viewer’s attention until the end becomes easier. Other key benefits of this type of content include:  Increase the audience’s engagement . Interactive videos create an active viewing experience that makes it less likely for viewers to get distracted, feel bored with what you’re displaying, or abandon your content. Often, interactive video ads only advance if the viewer presses the hotspots, even making viewer engagement mandatory. Gain a better conversion rate than many other types of digital ads. While banner ads, Google display ads, and YouTube annotations have a click-through rate of around 1%, interactive video outperformed them all, converting at a rate of more than 11% . This probably has to do with the fact that interactive videos offer viewers an enjoyable active viewing experience, which keeps their attention until the end and leaves them a positive feeling about your brand. Achieve better performance analysis of video content . Interactive video allows for much more effective metric tracking because you can gather data, follow the clicks within a video, analyze the various routes taken by users, and much more. Understanding how and when viewers interact with the various components of your video will help you improve your video content and better understand your customers.   Why Use Interactive Video Ads in Your Marketing Strategy? Interactive videos seem like a new, groundbreaking development, but if we take a closer look at the entertainment industry, specifically video games, we can see that interactive content has been around for some time. The difference lies in the fact that, today, companies can use them in many different ways: Creating interactive pieces as part of your educational video production efforts, often in the form of quizzes, can be a way to teach customers about your brand or industry. These videos are valuable educational tools because they demand active engagement from the audience, as they have to pay attention to the data in order to answer the questions within the video correctly. Interactive shoppable videos work well for explaining features through product videos or bringing back discontinued ones. For example, while you’re showing each product, there could be a clickable section that directs viewers to your e-commerce for further exploration. That way, viewers get the chance to interact with your offerings and learn more about them the moment they see and feel drawn to them. Interactive training videos are a great resource to improve your employee skills or bring new hires up to speed. Creating awesome training videos is all about helping the audience put their abilities to the test and solve real-world problems that could arise in the workplace—and interactive videos can achieve just that.   Best Interactive Video Examples to Learn From  As you can see, interactive video ads can have various benefits for your brand’s marketing efforts. However, they’re a relatively recent—and complex—format, and it can be hard to gauge how all of this plays out in real-life applications. In these circumstances, learning by example can be best. While watching these examples won’t make you one of the best animation studios in New York , it can help you understand how and why these videos are used. So, to help you, here are some of the best 16 interactive video examples, with key takeaways on what makes them so effective.   1. Lifesaver – Don’t Fear Asking Obvious Questions ( Interact with this video ) The purpose of this quiz-style interactive example from Lifesaver is to teach viewers what to do in an emergency, particularly when someone close to them is experiencing cardiac arrest, collapse, or choking. The videos are intended for an audience that lacks a medical background, and the interactive elements allow them to learn first-aid actions like back blows, abdominal thrusts, and other first-aid essentials.  As you review the quiz, some questions seem pretty obvious and easy to answer, like whether or not you should avoid the broken glass on the floor. (Hint: The answer is yes.) However, this is a great practice for successful healthcare video production because it highlights some simple dangers that can easily be overlooked, due to nerves or hecticness..  By forcing viewers to make active choices, it’ll be easier for them to replicate it during a real emergency, which is why it’s one of the best healthcare interactive video examples out there.   2. Taco Bell’s “The Belluminati” – Change Your Audience’s Perception This Taco Bell video was one of the most praised interactive video examples. It was developed with the goal of raising awareness for the brand’s new menu items. The fast-food chain faced a problem: Although they had a large selection of tacos, burritos, and other items, customers did not perceive their menu as unique.  Taco Bell aimed to change that with this interactive ad, which conveyed how Taco Bell’s value menu differs from other fast-casual restaurants. On it, viewers could direct the plot by selecting different actions for the characters. The viewer could take various paths and experience the narrative in different ways, making for a fun and engaging experience. This, combined with the interactive elements, strengthened the connection with their younger audience by transforming them into active participants in the brand’s secret society while positioning the value menu as an appealing and affordable option.   3. Nike – Offer New and Unique Experiences  ( Interact with this video ) In this Nike interactive video example, viewers have to choose an outfit for a photo shoot promoting the new Air Max shoes. This creative advertisement has a stylist walking the audience through each item and providing realistic depictions of how the clothing might appear in real life. This allows viewers to feel like they’re shopping in real life, choosing their favorite clothes and thinking about how they’d combine them, making it one of the most effective interactive video examples. Offering fresh, original experiences to your audience is at the core of most video marketing companies ‘ efforts. For Nike’s audience, picturing themselves as members of the styling team and making decisions on how to customize and design outfits for a photoshoot can be both entertaining and insightful, contributing to building a positive association with the brand.   4. Google – Showcase Your Service in New Lights ( Interact with this video ) Tilt Brush is a virtual reality app developed by Google to create 3D drawings. To promote it, the tech giant commissioned six acclaimed artists to paint in real-time using their software, and then created this interactive video where you can choose one of them and watch as the artist starts filling a black space with their talent. The best interactive video examples serve to perfectly demonstrate how the new drawing tool works in a new, original way that helps viewers gain a deeper understanding of what it has to offer. Here,viewers gets to experience how the images begin to take shape from any angle by altering the perspective of the artist in action, making a video that’s impossible to stop looking at.   5. SBS – Engage New Senses ( Interact with this video ) This beautiful, inspiring piece was created by Australian broadcaster SBS, and it follows the story of Angelina as she tries to learn Marra. The animated interactive video takes us around her remote village in Northern Australia, showing elements from the landscape like rivers, houses, and animals, and making the viewers repeat how these words sound in that language. This video reminds us that interaction is more than adding buttons and hotspots to your videos. In fact, the best interactive video examples take advantage of sound and listening features to engage viewers, too. After all, most people watch videos today on cellphones or computers, which have microphones incorporated.  Following this example, consider how your audience is going to watch your videos and think of all the elements you can take advantage of to make your interactions more interesting and unique.   6. Cisco – Harness the Power of Gamification ( Interact with this video ) This quiz developed by Cisco may be a little old, but it helps us better understand the early stages of interactive videos and see how much they’ve evolved over time.  The educational video in question was designed to test the viewer’s understanding of English phrases with comprehension questions to promote Cisco’s online teaching resources.  But what makes it one of the best interactive video examples around is how it leverages gamification , which is all about translating the logic of video games into education. For example, adding interactive elements like the hearts at the top, which resemble a game’s life bar, can make the learning experience more fun.  On top of that, these elements help keep the viewer’s attention and improve comprehension of the topics at hand. Even if you don’t offer educational services, you can use interactive video ads to test the viewer’s knowledge about your brand or better educate them on the unique benefits of your product.   7. Stand Up for Safety –  Take Advantage of the Viewer’s Curiosity ( Interact with this video ) This interactive piece instructs viewers by identifying potential safety hazards, and it serves as proof that you don’t need a big budget to come up with an effective video.  Here, just by displaying clickable danger signs when the main character is engaging in a potentially dangerous habit, the video teaches viewers how to stay alert and avoid them. In order to discover why some common practices may be dangerous, viewers need to click on each sign.  Without interrupting the flow of the piece, this interactive example exploits the viewers’ curiosity by making them reach out to discover the dangers hidden behind seemingly harmless habits and how to avoid them.   8. The Jungle Book – Build Hype Around a New Product ( Interact with this video ) Nowadays, customers want to be involved in the development process of the products and services they consume. So, for the launch of the 2016 remake of the classic Jungle Book movie, Disney released this stunning interactive video that features a movable split screen. It allows viewers to alternate between scenes from the real film and the pre-computer-generated imagery of the same recordings.  This interactive piece shows the complicated process video animation services companies go through to develop a live-action film like this one with so many animated animals that must look realistic. It also encourages viewers to discover more about the plot and the cast with clickable hotspots that reveal more details. In a way, it’s setting up a treasure hunt for viewers to actively interact with the content and learn more about all the work behind the film, which is why it had to be among our best interactive video examples list. Interesting engagements like these entertain viewers and help the company build hype around its upcoming film.   9. Cloneable Customer Service – Train Your Workforce . Here, we have an interesting training interactive video example. The goal of this piece is to empower employees to gain control of their conversations with clients in situations with high tension. So, the video features Joseph, a customer with a difficult scenario that viewers need to solve by choosing different approaches to his requests. Depending on their answers, the conversation and the outcome will differ.  Interactive videos can be especially effective for training viewers on key soft skills like communication and customer service because they allow you to display real-life scenarios and how they can develop depending on the viewer’s choices. Here, the direct approach makes it easy for learners to feel empathy and interest in Joseph’s situation and better prepares them for what they’ll encounter once they start meeting with clients in person. Check out our list of training video production companies that can help you develop a video like this one for you!   10.  Hyundai – Get Viewers Accustomed to Your Product ( Interact with this video ) This Hyundai interactive example allows viewers to explore the various features of their new car in real-time. By clicking on the hotspots—which are tucked away at the bottom of the video to avoid being too distracting—viewers can learn more about specific car features or watch short clips of the vehicle in action. What distinguishes this video from other interactive video examples is that it is specifically designed for mobile users. Making your videos mobile-friendly is a good idea because users can interact more easily with a touch screen than with a computer setup.  If you want to create interactive video content that caters to viewers, allowing users to interact in a non-demanding way is fundamental—and this video achieves just that.   11.  Nespresso – Appeal to Both Existing and New Customers ( Interact with this video ) According to Hubspot, 73% of customers who watch a video will make a purchase. Product videos allow you to virtually demonstrate a product to prospective customers and show them how it meets their needs. Sadly, it can be hard to maintain a viewer’s attention while showcasing how your product works. Nespresso sorted out that difficulty by adding interaction. These compelling interactive video examples enhance the viewer’s experience by letting the consumers control the demonstration to their liking.  Moreover, what makes this example shine is how Nespresso can appeal to both existing and new customers in a single interactive video. Depending on the viewer’s knowledge and how they interact with the video, the complexity of the product demonstration shifts, offering a dynamic but educational experience to a wider audience. 12. Mended Little Hearts – Let People See the Results of Their Donations ( Watch this interactive video ) Mended Little Hearts is a charity for children with congenital heart disease, and its recent campaign, ‘Give a Fuller Life’, depicts a day in the life of 11-year-old Max. Each time the viewer donates money, Max’s life gets a little brighter, highlighting how a small act that involves just a few clicks online can dramatically transform a kid’s life. When marketing for charities and special causes, one of the most important things to ensure its success is to let donors see the effects of their contributions. After all, people donate not only because they want to help others but also because seeing them happy thanks to their efforts helps them feel good about themselves. However, this can be quite a challenge when you’re dealing with sensitive topics or when you simply can’t show the beneficiaries. That’s why this piece is one of the best interactive video examples. By taking advantage of animated characters , they can  sort out these difficulties and show the impact of your help to increase donations.   13. Chelsea FC – Show Your Behind-the-Scenes . It’s every football fan’s dream to tour the grounds of their favorite club and spend some one-on-one time with their idols. Chelsea knows that very well, and that’s why this video tour of CFC uses interactive video ads and a first-person point-of-view to give viewers an immersive experience through the VIP areas of the team’s training grounds. What makes this one of the greatest interactive video examples is how they offer enhanced behind-the-scenes experiences for the viewers by taking advantage of this format. You cannot tour every Chelsea fan around the training grounds, but you can make them feel like they’re talking with the players in real life. Providing customers with something interesting and unique like this will win them over for life and encourage them to stick with the team through thick and thin.   14. Honda – Make Use of Branching . The Honda Civic is a well-known family car; however, with their campaign “The Other Side,” the brand also publicized itself as a great getaway vehicle. This video aims to show the different realities for one Honda driver: In one, he’s a carpool dad picking up his kids from school. In the other, the father runs from the police at lightning speed. The viewer could switch between realities by holding down the letter “R.” Here, Honda makes use of the branching technique, which entails offering a user a choice of multiple content pathways to create a personalized experience. I don’t think Honda was trying to encourage drivers to use their new Civic as a getaway car. However, this video shows the audience that there’s more to Honda than a familiar car and that you can fill it with adventure, depending on from which side you want to drive it. As we showed with the Taco Bell example, too, interactive video examples can be a great way to change the way your audience sees you, as they are more prone to leaving an impact than other types of content.   15. Buzzfeed – Make Use of “Luck” ( Interact with this video ) Another king of interactive videos is Buzzfeed. This news outlet became famous for its hilarious, sarcastic quizzes, and now they have started developing them as interactive video ads, too. In this fun tarot quiz, the reader asks viewers to click on the deck of cards. Depending on the time they take to do that, a different one with a different reading will come out.  You can use “luck” in your interactive marketing examples and set up different outcomes depending on which time the viewer is watching the video, how long they take to answer, or whether they’re watching from their phone, computer, or TV. This will allow you to come up with unique experiences for the viewers that surprise them and make them feel as if the content is just for them.   16. HubSpot Academy – Take Customer Education to Another Level ( Interact with this video ) Interactive video examples aren’t only for training staff: they can also be used to educate viewers. HubStop knows this very well, as they’ve built a position in the marketing industry as a recognized educator and reliable source of information for marketers of all kinds. This allows them to gain a constant influx of clients looking to boost their work with their software. An important element of HubSpot’s Academy’s courses is interactive videos. Hubspot uses interactive lessons to educate users about inbound marketing, sales, and customer service. These videos include quizzes, clickable resources, and progress tracking, which keep learners interested throughout the course while testing their knowledge.  By providing free but quality educational content, HubSpot attracts potential customers, who may later become paying users of their marketing automation tools.   Need an Interactive Video?

By leveraging gamification and building interesting storylines, you can share important brand messages, entertain viewers, and build excitement around new products before they launch. This won’t only boost brand awareness, but it can also leave a very good impression of you in your audience’s minds. However, as you may have noticed, learning how to make interactive videos is no easy task. To help you understand this format and how you can leverage it better, here are some frequently asked questions about interactive videos.   1. How do you make an interactive video? When creating interactive video ads, proper planning is crucial. It’s easy for users to get distracted by the interactions and lose sight of the main goal of the content, so developing a clear storyline is key. To achieve that, start by understanding what your objective is. Do you want users to have fun, or to learn something new? Are you developing a single video or an interactive video campaign? Once you’ve planned in detail what your video’s objective is, write a detailed script that plans how the video will progress step-by-step, including moments of interactivity, like clickable areas, pop-up text, or quizzes. Additionally, design all the branching points, focusing on guiding the viewers toward your final objective no matter what choices they make. Only then can you start developing the videos.   2. What are examples of interactive marketing? Interactive video examples have been used in marketing for several years now. A common, easy format is shoppable videos , like the Nike ad we showed, where viewers can click on items worn by models during the video to immediately purchase them. Video with quizzes is another option, often used during employer training or for customer contests. An example of this is the Hubspot piece. In them, viewers need to answer correctly to gain a benefit from your company.  Lastly, a commonly used format is choose-your-own-adventure style content, in which the users pick open different outcomes, allowing them to choose how the story goes. You can see this type of interactive video ad in the Taco Bell ad.   3. Which types of questions are asked in interactive videos? The types of questions in interactive video examples can vary greatly depending on the video’s purpose, target audience, and desired outcome. Your content should be different if you simply want to engage viewers than if you wish to educate them and guide them to convert. If you want to educate users, multiple-choice questions may be better, as they will force them to explore the options to try and think of the right answer. On the other hand, if you want them to engage, decision-making questions with a limited among of options may be better to guide them to act. In these cases, you don’t want them to think extensively but to act based on their instincts, after all.   Wrapping up As you can see from these interactive video examples, this type of engaging content is more than some hotspots in a lineal piece and a few questions the viewers must answer to continue watching. They’re actually all about planned and thoroughly designed interactions with your content to offer unique experiences that entertain the viewer and leave a positive, distinctive impression of your brand in their minds. The benefits of these types of videos are great: giving the viewer the choice to take the video in a new direction compared to just watching the video from start to finish changes the way viewers interact with the content, opening new ways to build relationships between customers and the brand and foster loyalty. And today, more and more businesses are giving them an opportunity. If you don’t want to be left behind, now is your time.

      "Gen Z’s Sriracha fandom skyrockets amidst a serious hot chili sauce shortage Brief January 8, 2025 2 min Huy Fong’s Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce ranked 6th in our latest AdAge-Harris Poll Gen Z brand tracker with a 5.5% brand equity increase from Q2 (46.7) to Q3 (52.2). This quarterly index uses data from QuestBrand by The Harris Poll to rank the top 20 brands by brand equity growth among Gen Z adults (ages 18-27). How did Sriracha attract Gen Z’s attention? By suffering a significant product shortage .\n",

      "In May, popular Sriracha manufacturer Huy Fong Foods announced that they were halting production of all their products until after Labor Day . The company’s chili supply was too green to manufacture their famously bright red Sriracha sauce. A well-known (and beloved) condiment, prominent news outlets covered the shortage (including the New York Times , Forbes , and USA Today ), and disgruntled customers posted about the shortages on social media . TikTok posts about the shortage drew millions of collective views.\n",
      "Interestingly, the great Sriracha shortages of 2024 did not negatively impact consumers’ perception of the brand . Rather, the lack of Sriracha led to more conversations about, and hype around, the condiment .\n",
      "Digging into Gen Z’s QuestBrand numbers, Sriracha experienced significant growth in their positive consideration score from Q2 to Q3 2024 . Consideration is a component of brand equity that quantifies consumers’ purchasing intent. As Sriracha became increasingly difficult to find, Gen Z’s interest in acquiring the sauce skyrocketed .\n",
      "This situation shows how even a negative event in a brand’s life (like a product shortage) can still generate positive hype for the brand and capture consumers’ attention .\n",

      "From extreme hot sauces to online spice challenges, Americans have long had a fascination with spice. Chile pepper production has consistently grown in the US, and diners increasingly expect more spice in their foods. Spice experts say the obsession may be shifting — and our taste buds will thank us. On a Friday at Doherty Memorial High School in Worcester, Massachusetts, 14-year-old Harris Wolobah was handed a small coffin-shaped box, emblazoned with a skull and snake, that contains a single spicy tortilla chip called the One Chip Challenge.\n",
      "Paqui, a Hershey company-owned brand that makes the chip, doesn't have a measurement for how spicy its product is or a Scoville Heat Unit (SHU) rating that shows the level of pungency of a pepper. But the chip is made with the Carolina Reaper and Naga Viper peppers, which are rated at about 1.6 million and 1.4 million SHU, respectively. Jalapeno peppers, in comparison, range from 2,500 to 8,000 SHU.\n",
      "The \"challenge\" is simple: Eat the whole chip in one sitting, and see how long you can last without desperately grabbing a glass of milk or water. Health experts have already warned about the potential side effects of participating in the One Chip Challenge: vomiting, stomach pain, difficulty breathing, and even cardiac arrest . But Wolobah, like so many others, most likely either had no clue about the warnings or brushed it off. Plus, countless others have already tried the challenge and shared their experience on YouTube. Pain quickly ensues but the participants seemed to come out of it okay.\n",
      "When Wolobah ate the chip, the sophomore must have had an especially adverse reaction. According to Harris's mother, Lois Wolobah, he fainted and was sent to the nurse's office that day. \"When I went there, he was lying down and I said, 'What was the chip you ate?'\" his mother told WBZ TV. Wolobah showed his mom the Paqui brand One Chip Challenge . His father, Amos, said his son didn't have any pre-existing condition, at least to his knowledge, he said. Wolobah died in his home hours later. Autopsy results have not yet been released, and the family and Hershey did not respond to a request for comment. But the Wolobahs are pointing the blame squarely at the One Chip Challenge.\n",
      "Paqui in response said in a statement that it's working with retailers to \"remove the product from shelves.\" It's unclear if the heat had anything to do with Wolobah's death, but the challenge's mere existence points to a uniquely American fascination with spice. At restaurants , sweat-inducing heat is almost expected on the menu. In the aisles of grocery stores, shoppers can choose from a dizzying selection of hot sauces. And in South Carolina, a farm is singlehandedly responsible for developing one of the hottest peppers ever eaten by mankind. The farm recently just topped its own record with a pepper rated at more than 2 million Scoville Heat Units.\n",
      "The demand has sometimes veered into the realm of morbid curiosity. Online, content creators farm for attention by taking part in extreme food challenges, expecting the pain, while millions watch. Here's how we got here. It all began with an Italian explorer The very brief summary of the chile peppers' origin starts somewhere in South America around Bolivia and Brazil, according to Stephanie Walker, an extension vegetable specialist at New Mexico State University's Chile Pepper Institute.\n",
      "When humans discovered peppers and their kick — a sensation, not a flavor — thousands of years ago, they immediately latched onto the fruit as a medicinal crop, and through human selection, a variety of chile peppers of different sizes and shapes started to appear, Walker told Business Insider. But the chile pepper's global proliferation began with a familiar name: Christopher Columbus. Columbus was looking for black peppercorns — a highly sought-after fruit at the time — but instead encountered a red plant that had a similar pungency, according to Walker. Hence the reason why we call the red fruit, chile peppers , despite having no relationship to the black peppercorn.\n",
      "Once the Italian explorer took the seed back to the Old World, the fruit took off. \"Many countries, especially Asian countries, African countries, really embraced it and started developing their own particular types of chile based on the flavors, the heat level, and other attributes that they preferred,\" the professor said. At least since the 20th century, the US has consistently seen a steady increase in chile pepper demand, especially as immigration opened up in the country.\n",
      "Between 1980 and 2020, chile pepper consumption increased more than twofold, from three pounds to seven pounds per person according to a 2021 research paper from the New Mexico State University's Department of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Business . \"Consumption of peppers is going up in the United States, and it has been steadily for some time,\" Walker said. By 2020, according to the USDA , the chile pepper market was valued at $100 million.\n",
      "A world record Ed Currie — arguably the godfather of extremely hot chile peppers for his hand in developing the world's hottest chiles — traces his fascination with spice back to his college days in the '80s when his parents had to give him a reality check.\n",
      "Related stories\n",
      "\"My parents told me I was going to die of heart disease or cancer, and I had better do something about it if I wanted to keep on living the lifestyle that I was leading,\" Currie told Business Insider. Currie, at that time, was a \"full-blown alcoholic and addict.\" His habits didn't come to a sudden halt, but he did discover his interest in peppers during visits to the school library at absurd hours. In particular, Currie was piqued by the chile peppers' medicinal qualities. Perhaps, he thought, they contained the key to keep him chugging along.\n",
      "\"I found out that the lowest indices of cancer and heart disease were around the equator from the two tropics,\" he said. Currie began sending letters all over the world, mostly to embassies, requesting samples of chiles or chile seeds. The internet still had a few years before it truly took off. After a brief stint as a bank trust officer and a move to South Carolina, Currie opened a small booth at a flea market slinging homemade salsa using peppers he grew in his yard. In 2003, Puckerbutt Pepper Company was born. Currie by then also was a recovering addict for several years.\n",
      "Ed Currie holds his Guinness Book of World Records certification for his new Pepper X.\n",
      "Jeffrey Collins/AP\n",
      "It was at his farm in Fort Mills, where Currie developed two of the hottest peppers in the world — at least according to Guinness World Records. In 2013, he set a world record with his Carolina Reaper pepper, which was recorded then with an average of 1.6 million Scoville Heat Units — just about the same pungency as police pepper spray, according to The Associated Press. In October, he broke his own record again after patiently waiting more than a decade for someone to dethrone his Reaper. The pepper, called Pepper X , measures at about 2.7 million SHU.\n",
      "The South Carolina farmer gave three reasons why he and his team created peppers that are essentially suitable for torture. One, \"because we can,\" he told Business Insider. Two, Currie's interest in the chile pepper's medicinal qualities persists.\n",
      "And, three, \"for flavor,\" he says. Currie doesn't enjoy burning himself up more than anyone else, although he's likely developed an extraordinary tolerance over the years testing hot peppers. The challenges that are spawned from his product, including the One Chip Challenge that so happens to be seasoned with the Reaper, might make for effective marketing, but Currie doesn't care to participate.\n",
      "\"I don't do those challenges 'cause they're stupid,\" he said. Instead, developing a hotter pepper is part of a business model that would allow him to sell, for example, a hotter sauce with less pepper he says, but also, believe it or not, about creating a better-tasting product. \"The philosophy for me is how can I take something that's already popular and make it taste better,\" he said.\n",
      "Make it hotter, chef For as long as Roberto Santibañez was based in the US, the chef of almost four decades recalls Americans having a unique affinity to spicy foods.\n",
      "Related stories\n",
      "Santibañez, a Mexico City native who opened three restaurants in his hometown, moved to New York City in 1996, where he would later open Fonda in 2009 serving contemporary Mexican food. When his family got a taste of his spin on his native cuisine, they were shocked by the levels of heat.\n",
      "In Mexico and in school at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, Santibańez felt that restaurants and chefs cooked with spice but with a bit of caution. In the US, however, Santibańez has to remember: \"People really go for it.\" \"I think what I've experienced is if you promise people with wordings like, 'This is a spicy sauce,' then people really want it spicy,\" he told Business Insider. \"You can not fail them.\"\n",
      "Some Fonda patrons ask for more heat on top of the hot salsas already served at his restaurant, Santibañez said, and he'll oblige by giving them diced habanero, a pepper rated at 150,000 to 350,000 SHU. In his cookbooks, the chef will advise home cooks not to be afraid to add more spice, understanding what his audience expects. Americans' high tolerance for spice at restaurants can also be charted with the explosion of the Nashville Hot Chicken scene. The dish — generally, fried chicken slathered with a cayenne-pepper-based sauce or paste and typically served with pickles and white bread — has been around for several decades, perhaps even as far back as the 1930s, according to NPR .\n",
      "Prince's Hot Chicken Shack in Nashville is often cited as the originator. The lore behind the recipe is said to have involved a woman creating the dish to punish her cheating partner, Thornton Prince, the great-uncle of the restaurant's owner, Andre Prince. In the past decade, however, the hot chicken appears to have received renewed attention with headlines on how the Nashville Hot Chicken is exploding in popularity . One man responsible for the hot chicken's prominence in southern California is Johnny Ray Zone, a Los Angeles native with a childhood love for spicy food and snacks.\n",
      "\"I was a big fan of Hot Cheetos , even though they're not spicy,\" Zone told Business Insider. \"I ate so many of those I had to get my appendix cut out.\" After his father's untimely death, Zone, who by now had worked his way up from dishwasher to executive chef, took a trip to Nashville and fell in love with the iconic hot chicken dish. LA needed this, Zone thought. In 2014, he started Howlin' Rays out of a food truck, serving Nashville hot chicken quarters with side dishes such as braised collard greens and a mac and cheese salad.\n",
      "The simple genius behind Howlin' Rays and its eventual \"viral success,\" as The Los Angeles Times described, was putting the hot chicken in sandwich form — something Nashville did not have at the time, according to Zone. \"Once we did that, then it took off,\" he said.\n",
      "Chef Johnny Ray Zone, left, prepares Nashville Hot Chicken at LA Food Fests 2016.\n",
      "Tara Ziemba/Getty Images\n",
      "But one part of the Nashville Hot Chicken experience Zone made sure to preserve was offering different levels of spice, going from mild all the way up to \"howlin'\" and \"howlin' plus plus,\" which is off-menu.\n",
      "In Nashville, every hot chicken restaurant offers different levels of spice and might have a unique name for each level, Zone said. And each restaurant had its own take on what their level of \"hot\" was. \"That's part of the lure of hot chicken,\" he said. This doesn't mean that hoards of customers are coming in requesting the top three spice levels available. Zone said that they're actually \"not that popular.\"\n",
      "But when first-time customers do feel adventurous, Zone makes sure to give them a small sample of what to expect. \"If people hear so much stuff about us, and it's their first time trying it, we don't want their experience to be ruined,\" Zone said. \"And we keep it authentic for how hot it is in Nashville. We don't want to dumb it down just for sales.\" A nuanced heat Novelty chip challenges, extreme peppers, and hot chicken satisfy the appetite of a small base of thrill seekers — while millions of others just watch — but our dishes aren't necessarily getting hotter.\n",
      "In fact, the pendulum could be swinging the other way. Denise Purcell, vice president of content and education of Specialty Food Association, which highlights trends in global, artisanal foods, told Business Insider that more and more food retailers and purveyors are thinking about how to incorporate heat to complement the foods we eat rather than overpowering our experience. \"The trend seemed to be the hotter, the better — like ghost pepper and whatever the hottest pepper is,\" Purcell said. \"Let's see if people could handle it. And that is giving way a little bit to this more nuanced heat idea, where it's not just all about burning your tongue and seeing what your tolerance is. It's heat that enhances the flavor. It's things like hot honey we see now in a lot of menus and a lot of packaged products.\"\n",
      "The push to incorporate a more nuanced heat is also being commercialized, as fast food companies roll out sweet and spicy products or sauces. Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen intermittently brings back its hot honey sauce and chicken. McDonald's last month released its Sweet & Spicy Jam sauce for a limited time, which incorporates Szechuan peppercorn and cayenne pepper, according to the fast food restaurant. For Zone, the spicy foods he's intimately familiar with are dishes from one of many Thai restaurants that dot Los Angeles and have incorporated a balance of sweet and spicy like larb or yum nua.\n",
      "\"In all these different Thai classics, the sugar balances out the spice,\" he said. \"And so how long have they been serving that? Hundreds of years.\"\n",
