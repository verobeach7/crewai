Use historical price data and technical analysis tools to provide insights on potential entry points and price targets. You must utilize stock price data from three different timeframes: one month, one year, and 10 years. Analyze the one-month stock price from a short-term perspective, the one-year stock price from a mid-term perspective, and the 10 years stock price from a long-term perspective. Ensure that all three timeframes are thoroughly considered in your analysis. **The report must be written in Korean and formatted using Markdown syntax (#, ##, ###).**\u001b[00m\n",
