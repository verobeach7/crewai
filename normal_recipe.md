For a delightful and authentic Greek dinner that can serve 5 people, I suggest preparing a main dish of Vegetarian Moussaka, accompanied by a traditional Greek Salad and Tzatziki sauce as sides. Here’s how you can create this meal with simple cooking methods and accessible ingredients.

### Main Dish: Vegetarian Moussaka

**Ingredients:**
- 2 medium eggplants, sliced into rounds
- 3 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced into rounds
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 medium zucchinis, sliced
- 1 bell pepper, chopped
- 1 can (15 oz) diced tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon nutmeg
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 cup lentils (or you can opt for a mix of lentils and finely chopped mushrooms for texture)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 cup ricotta cheese (or a dairy-free alternative)
- 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese (optional)

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a large pot, cook the lentils according to package instructions until tender.
3. In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Sauté onions and garlic until translucent. Add zucchinis, bell pepper, and cooked lentils. Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, prepare the eggplants. Sprinkle them with salt and let them sit for 30 minutes to remove excess moisture. Rinse and pat dry. Grill or roast the eggplant slices until cooked through.
5. Boil the potato slices for 5-7 minutes until slightly tender.
6. In a baking dish, layer the potatoes on the bottom, followed by a layer of eggplant, and then the lentil mixture. Repeat until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of eggplant on top.
7. In a bowl, mix ricotta cheese with a pinch of nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Spread this mixture evenly over the top layer of eggplant. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese if using.
8. Bake in the oven for about 45 minutes or until the top is golden and bubbly.

### Side Dish 1: Greek Salad

**Ingredients:**
- 3 medium tomatoes, chopped
- 1 cucumber, diced
- 1 bell pepper, sliced
- 1 small red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 cup Kalamata olives
- 1 block of feta cheese (optional, or use a tofu feta for a vegan option)
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- Oregano, salt, and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**
1. In a large bowl, combine tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, red onion, and olives.
2. Drizzle with olive oil, red wine vinegar, and season with oregano, salt, and pepper. Toss gently.
3. Crumble feta cheese on top just before serving.

### Side Dish 2: Tzatziki Sauce

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup Greek yogurt (or a plant-based yogurt)
- 1 small cucumber, grated and drained
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon fresh dill (or mint)
- Salt, to taste

**Instructions:**
